# AHS Engineering and Technology Website

This website was made using Starlight and Astro. You can check [Starlightâ€™s docs](https://starlight.astro.build/) and [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build) to learn more.

## Google Calendar Integration

The upcoming meetings section (on the main page) pings a seperate server for the events. That server then reads the events from Google Calendar. This means no additional setup is needed for running this website locally.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
