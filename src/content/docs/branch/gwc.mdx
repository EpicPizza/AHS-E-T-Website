<Card title="Mission" icon="rocket"> 
    As the gender gap in technology fields grows, the world misses out on ideas from almost half the population. Now, more than ever, we need to eliminate this disparity. By learning to code with Girls Who Code, girls will be empowered to do more than crack the glass ceiling; theyâ€™ll shatter it!

### Goals

We will teach new members how to code in Python, Javascript, and Java as well as HTML and C+. We also plan on having guest speakers come and talk about their experience in the computer science field as women in stem.
