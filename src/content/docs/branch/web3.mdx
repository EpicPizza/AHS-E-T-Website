<Card title="Mission" icon="rocket"> 
    Weâ€™re building the only AHS community with a focus on the decentralized future of tech, finance, healthcare, art, and ultimately all fields. Through this collaborative, hands-on, and innovative environment, we aim to empower students to utilize Web3 technologies to revolutionize the way we interact, transact, and shape the future of the world. By tapping into the field that defines the future of Silicon Valley, we will prepare all prospective STEM and finance/econ students for the future, and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to be at the forefront of this emerging industry.
