### Activities

- Bi-weekly sessions on statistical programming through R and data visualization + their applications to medical diagnosis/genomics & financial concepts; also introduce statistical analysis concepts, including resampling methods, Monte Carlo methods, local regression, etc.
- Self-guided research project: utilizing computational statistics to tackle a STEM/economics-related research question & possibly write a research paper(s) synthesizing the findings
- Speaker events from professors & leaders in biostatistics/bioinformatics, data science, financial mathematics, etc.
