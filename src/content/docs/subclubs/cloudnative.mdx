### Quick Facts

import { Card, CardGrid, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Card title="Mission" icon="rocket"> 
    Our mission as a club is to help high schoolers gain more knowledge about the fundamentals of the cloud and how it works. Almost everyone uses the cloud without realizing it, and we believe that it is important for people to understand more about it.

<Card title="Plans" icon="open-book">
    For the upcoming year, a big goal of ours is to prepare students for either the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, or the AWS Certified Solutions Architect. We plan to have meetings every week for about a hour. The sessions will be a mix of hands on activities, and lectures. Occasionally we will hold events such as quiz nights, and we will keep participants engaged through projects.
